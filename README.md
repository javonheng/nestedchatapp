This application allows user to login via their Google Account. When signed in, they will be able to access the Dashboard. On the Dashboard, users are able to view all the main Threads. Upon clicking the 'JOIN' button, users are directed to the chat room where they can reply to the current comments or reply to a single comment. Users are not able to edit and delete comments that are not posted by them.
